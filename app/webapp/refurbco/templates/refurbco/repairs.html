    <p>This page will use ajax and js to dynamically build the repairs database
        view, which will be very similar to the table on the inventory page, and the
        new repair form to create a repair and add it to the database.</p>
    <p> Another possible idea is to have a static table view of the repairs and
        have a pop-up dialog box to enter new repairs. We can decide this page later.</p>
